This project is to test my ability to write codes in **javaScript**, and it's for the _Connect Intensive - Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree_ from Udacity.
It's a simple game that allows the user to help the cat to get safely to the other side by avoiding the cars and collecting gems on the way.


How To Run
===============================
- Open the file.
- Look for index.html and open it in the prowser.
- Now you will be able to play the game.

How To Play
===============================
1. You will start with 3 hearts to play.
1. By using the four arrows in your keyboard, move the cat up, down, left and right.
2. Make the cat cross the road safely by avoiding the moving cars, and collect the gems in your way.
3. Collecting the gems will increase your score and hearts as follow:
   - The green gem: 10 points.
   - The red gem: 20 points.
   - The blue diamond: 30 points + one heart.
4. Colliding with a car will decrease you hearts, and if you have no more hearts, you will lose the game.
5. If it happens that you lost the game, a board will appear with your score, a message, and a button to restart the game.

Try to avoid the cars and collect as many gems as you can! **_Good Luck!_**
